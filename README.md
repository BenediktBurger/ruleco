# RuLECO

Rust implementation of the [Laboratory Experiment COntrol (LECO) protocol](https://github.com/pymeasure/leco-protocol). For a fully featured implementation (in Python), see [PyLECO](https://github.com/pymeasure/pyleco).

**Note**: LECO is still under development, such that the code and API might change.
The LECO protocol branch [pyleco-state](https://github.com/pymeasure/leco-protocol/tree/pyleco-state) contains the assumptions used in this project, which are not yet accepted into the LECO main branch.
See this [documentation](https://leco-laboratory-experiment-control-protocol--69.org.readthedocs.build/en/69/) for the LECO definitions including these assumptions.
These things might change, if LECO defines them differently.

You are welcome to contribute, especially commenting on code improvements, as this is my first contact with rust.
